Ensuring the functionality and security of my code, program, or software is crucial to me. I prioritize thorough testing, incorporating continuous integration, and implementing security measures like input validation and data encryption. 
When it comes to interpreting user needs, I believe in actively engaging with end-users through surveys and usability testing to understand their requirements deeply.
This helps me translate their needs into actionable features, prioritizing those that align with both user expectations and technical feasibility. 
In designing software, I value setting clear objectives, establishing a robust architectural foundation, and fostering collaboration among cross-functional teams. 
By embracing agile methodologies, I can adapt to evolving requirements, delivering incremental value and refining the software based on user feedback and real-world usage data.
This approach allows me to create software that is not only functional and secure but also truly meets the needs of my users and aligns with our business objectives.
